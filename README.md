## PREPARATION FOR THE DATASET

### 1. Discontinuous time
- **For the part with excessive missing data:**  
  Filter data, retaining only records from July 1, 2015.
- **For the part with fewer missing data:**  
  Add missing dates and impute missing values in the `adr` column using the column's median (accounting for high standard deviation).

### 2. Multiple `adr` values for the same date
- Group data by reservation status date and hotel type, then calculate the daily average price.
